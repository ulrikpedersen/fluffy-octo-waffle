# Demo remark presentation

This demonstrates the use of [remark](https://remarkjs.com/) to make presentations with the source defined in Markdown. The remark documentation can be found on this [wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki).

The source of the presentation material is in `presentation.md` and can be viewed on this repo's github.io page: 

You can also clone the repo and demo/extend the presentation locally with a simple webserver: `python3 -m http.server 8888` and opening the page on http://localhost:8888/index.html
